## Abstract
**Aim:** Half of heart failure (HF) patients have chronic kidney disease (CKD) complicating their pharmacological management. We evaluated physicians' and patients' patterns of use of evidence-based medical therapies in HF across CKD stages.

**Methods and results:** We studied HF patients with reduced (HFrEF) and mildly reduced (HFmrEF) ejection fraction enrolled in the Swedish Heart Failure Registry in 2009-2018. We investigated the likelihood of physicians to prescribe guideline-recommended therapies to patients with CKD, and of patients to fill the prescriptions within 90 days of incident HF (initiating therapy), to adhere (proportion of days covered ≥80%) and persist (continued use) on these treatments during the first year of therapy. We identified 31 668 patients with HFrEF (median age 74 years, 46% CKD). The proportions receiving a prescription for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers/angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ACEi/ARB/ARNi) were 96%, 92%, 86%, and 68%, for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥60, 45-59, 30-44, and <30 ml/min/1.73 m2 , respectively; for beta-blockers 94%, 93%, 92%, and 92%, for mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) 45%, 44%, 37%, 24%; and for triple therapy (combination of ACEi/ARB/ARNi + beta-blockers + MRA) 38%, 35%, 28%, and 15%. Patients with CKD were less likely to initiate these medications, and less likely to adhere to and persist on ACEi/ARB/ARNi, MRA, and triple therapy. Among stoppers, CKD patients were less likely to restart these medications. Results were consistent after multivariable adjustment and in patients with HFmrEF (n = 15 114).

**Conclusions:** Patients with HF and CKD are less likely to be prescribed and to fill prescriptions for evidence-based therapies, showing lower adherence and persistence, even at eGFR categories where these therapies are recommended and have shown efficacy in clinical trials.
